Development task: Traffic manger 

-----

Create an application that will consist from 3 parts
- Traffic Circle intersection - handles cars on circle. Size 8 cars at the time
- Input roads - generates car with specified frequency.
- Output roads - receives cars from intersection 

-----

All entities (roads and intersection) must be represented as goroutines. All communication between them must be implemented using typed channels
Each entity should have identifier and write to logs which car it generated/received/released

- Input roads:
-- First generates random number (from 0 to 5) of cars per second
-- Second generates 1 cars each second
-- Third generates car each two seconds
-- Fourth generates 10 cars per second

- Output roads:
-- First receives  random number (from 0 to 5) of cars per second
-- Second receives 1 cars each second
-- Third receives car each hour
-- Fourth receives 10 cars per second

- Traffic Circle intersection:
-- Can handle only 8 cars at the time
-- Outout road should be choosen randomly
-- Moving by circle takes 1 second for each exit
