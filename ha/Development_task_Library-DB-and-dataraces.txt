Development task: Library - DB and dataraces
Database: sqlite.

-------------

1. Implement new storage based on sqlite.
1.1 Both storages should be supported
1.1.1 Switching between storages must be implemented with app arguments
1.2 No SQL optimizations needed
1.3 gorm or xorm could be used 

2. Write 2 benchmarks for Create and Read handlers (Old but helpfull article https://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/30/how-to-write-benchmarks-in-go)
2.1 Write benchmarks in separate test file
2.2 Run benchmarks with both storages and compare results
2.3 Use argument -race to detect data races in code

-------------

All detected data races - have to be fixed
Benchmark results should be added to README.md
